This is the reports page for the application that has about 15 independent modules. 
Reports page is a menu option for each of them.

A list of reports is dynamically populated in a panel grid depending on the reports available for that module.
Each report has its own set of parameters, which are displayed on click of a selected report from the panel grid.
Parameters passed to the report are either a value or a reference to an object.
Values are represented by input fields or a checkbox.
References to objects are represented either by a list of values modal panel or by a dropdown menu.
